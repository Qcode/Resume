                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>
                    An enthusiastic computer programmer with a passion for both web and game development. I am big on automation and cleanliness in the development process. I see projects in the long-term, keeping future maintenance and best design patterns in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently employed with <a href='https://www.silverorange.com/'>silverorange</a> before beginning a degree in Honours Co-Op Computer Science at the Univeristy of Waterloo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time I enjoy playing piano, tinkering with Rubik's cubes, and reading a good book.
                </p>
